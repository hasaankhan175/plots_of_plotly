# Data Visualization with Plotting Library

This repository contains 15 different types of plots created using a plotting library. These plots are designed to showcase various data visualization techniques and can be used to gain insights and effectively communicate data.

## Plots

1. Scatter Plot: Visualize the relationship between two variables.
2. Line Plot: Display trends and patterns over time or continuous variables.
3. Bar Plot: Compare categorical data or display frequencies.
4. Box Plot: Visualize the distribution, central tendency, and variability of data.
5. Violin Plot: Show the distribution and density of data along with quartiles.
6. Histogram Plot: Visualize the distribution and frequency of continuous data.
7. Pie Plot: Display the proportion or percentage of categorical data.
8. 3D Pie Plot: Visualize proportions or percentages in a three-dimensional format.
9. Area Plot: Display cumulative values or proportions over time.
10. Sunburst Plot: Visualize hierarchical data and proportions across categories.
11. Parallel Coordinate Plot: Compare and analyze multivariate datasets.
12. Bubble Plot: Represent three variables using bubble size and color.
13. Density Plot: Visualize the distribution of data using smooth curves.
14. Ternary Plot: Visualize data in three dimensions, often used in compositional analysis.
15. Polar Plot: Display cyclical or periodic data, such as time series or directional data
